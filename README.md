# OpenClassrooms IML - Project 3 : Electricity Consumption and CO2 emissions of Buildings

The city of Seattle aims to be a carbon neutral city by 2050. To achieve this, the project team needs to study the emissions from non-housing buildings.
Careful surveys have already been done, but they are expensive to obtain.

My task as a data scientist was to try to predict the energy consumption and C02 emissions of buildings for which this has not been measured.

There is also a tedious piece of data to obtain, the EnergyStar score, the importance of which should be evaluated for predictions in order to know whether it can be excluded or not
